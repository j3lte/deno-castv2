# CastV2 (Deno rewrite)

This is a rewrite of the original
[node-castv2](https://github.com/thibauts/node-castv2) project in Deno. The
original project was written in Node.js (and no longer maintained).

This library is intended to be used as a base for building Cast v2 applications
in Deno. It is not a complete implementation and untested. Don't use it in
production.
